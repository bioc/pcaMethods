05/01/09 - Krzanowski CV changed so to not try to estimate Q2 for more
           PCs than possible.
02/01/10 - No warnings anymore when requesting SVD on matrix with missing
           values, silently switch to nipals.
         - New C++ implementation of nipals, save old R-version to
           'rnipals' for reference.
	 - Dependence on package Rcpp which made C++ implementation
           much easier.
	 - Successive introduction of Roxygen style documentation
           (.Rd files  are generated from the comment sections)
         - Successive introduction of using getter functions instead
           of '@'
         - Remove redundant 'checkData' calls from *pca functions,
           it is called   from pca()
         - Introduction of new X-validation approach which is
           applicable also for SVD.
10/27/08 - Improvements to slplot, bugfixes and a show method
02/27/08 - Replaced usage of exprSet class with ExpressionSet
04/10/07 - Added robustSVD, a SVD implementation robust to outliers
01/02/07 - Added a Non-linear PCA algorithm.
12/11/06 - kEstimate interface has changed. Instead of specifying a
           single value for the maximum number of pcs it is now possible
           to specify an array, e.g. c(3,5,7,9.20) or 3:7
12/11/06 - Added a cluster based imputation method called llsImpute.
           This is mainly thought for comparison with the other methods.
           kEstimate may also be used with llsImpute.
08/27/06 - This is the first revision of our pca package. Enjoy!
