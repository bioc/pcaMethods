#+TITLE: NEWS file for the pcaMethods package

* Version 1.27.2 <2010-01-05 Tue> 
- Krzanowski CV changed so to not try to estimate Q^2 for more
  PCs than possible.
* Version 1.27.0 <2010-01-02 Sat> 
- No warnings anymore when requesting SVD on matrix with missing
  values, silently switch to nipals.
- New C++ implementation of nipals, save old R-version to
  'rnipals' for reference.
- Dependence on package Rcpp which made C++ implementation
  much easier.
- Successive introduction of Roxygen style documentation
  (.Rd files  are generated from the comment sections)
- Successive introduction of using getter functions instead
  of '@'
- Remove redundant 'checkData' calls from *pca functions,
  it is called   from pca()
- Introduction of new X-validation approach which is
  applicable also for SVD.
* Version 1.24.0 <2008-10-27 Mon> 
- Improvements to slplot, bugfixes and a show method
* Version <2008-02-27 Wed> 
- Replaced usage of exprSet class with ExpressionSet
* Version <2007-04-10 Tue> 
- Added robustSVD, a SVD implementation robust to outliers
* Version <2007-01-02 Tue> 
- Added a Non-linear PCA algorithm.
* Version <2006-12-11 Mon> 
- kEstimate interface has changed. Instead of specifying a
  single value for the maximum number of pcs it is now possible
  to specify an array, e.g. c(3,5,7,9.20) or 3:7
* Version <2006-12-11 Mon> 
- Added a cluster based imputation method called llsImpute.
  This is mainly thought for comparison with the other methods.
  kEstimate may also be used with llsImpute.
* Version 1.0.0 <2006-08-27 Sun> 
- This is the first revision of our pca package. Enjoy!
* Planned
** C++ Versions
of ppca and possibly bpca. Nlpca would be nice and would probably benefit most of being ported to C++..
*** ppca							    :STARTED:
using gsl but speed gain so far not so remarkable
** Proper handling of scaling and centering 			    :STARTED:
Current version is broken and need full rewrite
