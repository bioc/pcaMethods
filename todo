Its annoying to get a different kind of result back when you give
pca() an exprSet instead of matrix as plotting etc doesnt work
then. Better would be to provide a as() function to allow for easy
conversion.

regarding Q2, removing diagonals are good but there is no
randomization anymore, this must be fixed. also it would be good if
you could suggest a percentage of missing values and that the method
itself would remove the appropriate amount of diagonals.
