\title{Bayesian PCA Missing Value Estimator}
\description{
	Implements a Bayesian PCA missing value estimator.
	The script is a port of the Matlab version provided by
	Shigeyuki OBA.
	See also \url{http://hawaii.aist-nara.ac.jp/\%7Eshige-o/tools/}.\cr
	BPCA combines an EM approach for PCA with
	a Bayesian model.
	In standard PCA data far from the training set but close to the
	principal subspace may have the same reconstruction error.
	BPCA defines a likelihood function such that the likelihood for data
	far from the training set is much lower, even if they are close to the
	principal subspace.

      Scores and loadings obtained with Bayesian PCA slightly differ
      from those obtained with conventional PCA.
      This is because BPCA was developed especially for missing value estimation.
	The algorithm does not force orthogonality between factor loadings,
	as a result factor loadings are not necessarily orthogonal.
	However, the BPCA authors found that including an orthogonality criterion made the
	predictions worse.\cr
      The authors also state that the difference between real and predicted
      Eigenvalues becomes larger when the number of observation is smaller,
      because it reflects the lack of information to accurately determine
      true factor loadings from the limited and noisy data.
	As a result, weights of factors to predict missing values are not the same as
	with conventional PCA, buth the missing value estimation is improved.\cr

	BPCA works iteratively, the complexity is growing with
	\eqn{O(n^3)}{O(n^3)} because several matrix inversions are required.
	The size of the matrices to invert depends on the number of components
	used for re-estimation.\cr
	Finding the optimal number of components for estimation is not a
	trivial task; the best choice depends on the internal structure of the
	data.
	A method called \code{kEstimate} is provided to estimate the optimal
	number of components via cross validation.
	In general few components are sufficient for reasonable estimation
	accuracy. See also the package documentation for further discussion
	about on what data PCA-based missing value estimation makes sense.\cr

	Requires \code{MASS}.

        It is not recommended to use this function directely but rather to use
        the pca() wrapper function.

\details{
	Details about the probabilistic model underlying BPCA are found in
	Oba et. al 2003. The algorithm uses an expectation maximation approach
	together with a Bayesian model to approximate the principal axes
	(eigenvectors of the covariance matrix in PCA).
	The estimation is done iteratively, the algorithm terminates if either
	the maximum number of iterations was reached or if the estimated
	increase in precision falls below \eqn{1e^{-4}}{1e^-4}.

	\bold{Complexity:} The relatively high complexity of the method is a result
	of several matrix inversions required in each step.
	Considering the case that the maximum number of iteration steps is needed,
	the approximate complexity is given by the term
	\deqn{maxSteps \cdot row_{miss} \cdot O(n^3)}{maxSteps * row_miss * O(n^3)}
	Where \eqn{row_{miss}}{row_miss} is the number of rows containing missing values
	and \eqn{O(n^3)}{O(n^3)} is the complexity for inverting a matrix of size
	\eqn{components}{components}. Components is the number of components
	used for re-estimation.

## Load a sample metabolite dataset (metaboliteData)
data(metaboliteData)

# Now remove 10\% of the data
rows <- nrow(metaboliteData)
cols <- ncol(metaboliteData)
cond<-matrix(runif(rows * cols),rows,cols) < 0.1
metaboliteData[cond] <- NA

## Perform Bayesian PCA with 2 components
result <- pca(metaboliteData, method="bpca", nPcs=2, center=FALSE)

## Get the estimated principal axes (loadings)
loadings <- result@loadings

## Get the estimated scores
scores <- result@scores

## Get the estimated complete observations
cObs <- result@completeObs

## Now plot the scores
plotPcs(result, scoresLoadings=c(TRUE,FALSE))
